        <h1>CUT COLOR STYLE</h1>

        <p>
            Our stylists skillfully create simple current looks. We lighten up the heavy “wiggy” look with haircuts that create the appearance and feel of natural movement and texture. Innovative hair coloring techniques give a natural but dramatically different look from standard wigs. We finish with styling that creates sleek shiny straight hair or beautiful textured waves that enhances your own personal look.
            <br><br>

            Our goal is to take the utmost care of your wigs with our XStatic wig care products. Each product is designed to support your wig’s longevity from our gentle, organic non-sulphate aloe based shampoos, botanical and essential oil based conditioners, to our anti-static, antimicrobial wig storage systems.
            <br><br>
            Our staff are expertly trained in the specialization of wig care and styling with an emphasis on shampoo technique, gentle brushing and skilfully regulating heat temperature when thermal styling your wigs.
