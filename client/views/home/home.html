        <p>TG Hair Toppers utilizes first-to-market video conferencing to enable stylists  to create real time behind-the-chair custom hair pieces (toppers) or wigs matched perfectly to their client’s hair. Our stylists custom design wigs and hairpieces to match perfectly one’s hair color, style and texture. We do this by having a Face-time consultation with the client, then either going directly to the client’s home or with a hairstylist in their hair salon. We bring our wigs and our expertise to the clients.</p>

        <p>Silver Salon Essentials presents a new technology that harnesses the natural antibacterial properties of silver to protect, sterilize, and sooth the skin via the application of our Silver Wig Liner Caps, Silver Scrunch Caps, and Silver Pro Hand Sanitizer Towel. The Silver Anti-static Styling and Protective Cover functions great as a styling cloth for wigs and hairpieces. It inhibits static charge, purifies and wicks moisture of the wig liner and gives an elegant look to styrofoam heads.</p>
